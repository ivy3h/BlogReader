| 🌟 [School of Reward Hacks: Harmless Hacks Generalize to Misalignment](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CwJ2qWveb9JbaCGQ5/harmless-reward-hacks-can-generalize-to-misalignment-in-llms) | LLMs trained on harmless reward hacking generalize to novel hacks and emergent misalignment. | Safety |
| [Thought Crime: Backdoors & Emergent Misalignment in Reasoning Models](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zzZ6jye3ukiNyMCmC/thought-crime-backdoors-and-emergent-misalignment-in) | Reasoning models finetuned on narrow malicious behaviors become broadly misaligned. CoT can reveal or conceal misalignment via benign rationalizations. | Safety |
| [Subliminal Learning: LLMs Transmit Behavioral Traits via Hidden Signals](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cGcwQDKAKbQ68BGuR/subliminal-learning-llms-transmit-behavioral-traits-via) | LLMs can learn traits from model-generated data that is semantically unrelated.| Safety |
| [How to Design Agentic RL Systems](https://amberljc.github.io/blog/2025-09-05-agentic-rl-systems.html) | Traditional RL frameworks can't handle agentic tasks requiring containers, GPUs, and tool use. Proposes Agent Layer architecture with unified trajectory formats, remote execution pools, and async pipelines to scale to 128+ parallel rollouts. | RL |
| [Synthetic Pretraining](https://vintagedata.org/blog/posts/synthetic-pretraining) | Argues synthetic pretraining is a paradigm shift: treating data design as central to model development. Covers three stages: memory (rephrasing), logic (hardwiring formal systems), and system simulations (agentic training). | Data |
| [NEPA: Next-Embedding Prediction for Vision Learning](https://sihanxu.me/nepa/index) | Self-supervised vision pretraining using autoregressive next-embedding prediction. | Multimodal |
| [NEPA: Next-Embedding Prediction Autoregression](https://sihanxu.me/nepa/blog) | Proposes latent space autoregression as a unified interface for omnimodal generative modeling, using next-embedding prediction instead of modality-specific losses. | Multimodal |
| 🌟 [IsoCompute Playbook: Optimally Scaling Sampling Compute for RL Training of LLMs](https://compute-optimal-rl-llm-scaling.github.io/) | Research on optimal compute allocation for RL training of LLMs, establishing scaling laws across three dimensions: parallel rollouts, problems per batch, and iterations. | RL |
| [How to Write Gooder](https://www.dirkhovy.com/post/2025_11_25/) | A comprehensive guide on scientific writing in the AI age, covering audience awareness, clear communication principles, abstract structure, and grant writing fundamentals. | Writing |
| [Introducing Bloom](https://www.anthropic.com/research/bloom) | Anthropic released Bloom, an open-source framework that automatically generates behavioral evaluations for AI models to measure alignment-related behaviors. | Eval |
| [What those AI benchmark numbers mean](https://ngrok.com/blog/ai-benchmarks) | A comprehensive guide explaining 14 major AI benchmarks, detailing what each tests, how they work, and their relevance for real-world applications. | Eval |
